Today, I am trying to create models for my game using Blender to be able to make some weapon models, and due to my lack of experience of never using Blender before I had to search online on YouTube for the common knowledge and tricks that a creator needs. For example, you are required to press shift + alt + click to move around. This is probably something I wouldn't figure out and it is very important because when I first downloaded it, I only knew that Shift + clicks rotate your camera, but doesn't allow me to move to a different position, so when editing the object it was very difficult to click when it is far away to edit. The next step was for me to create and hammer as a weapon because in my opinion, it was the easiest model due to not having curves when compared to a sword. I used 4 cube blocks to create the handle then used 3 cube blocks to make the head of the weapon. My next step in learning this blog is to create an actual sword, able to put texture and color onto the weapon and any additional model I might create.
