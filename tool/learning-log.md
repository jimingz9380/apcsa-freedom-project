### 12/10/23: Modeling Learning log 4
Today, I am trying to create models for my game using Blender to be able to make some weapon models, and due to my lack of experience of never using Blender before I had to search online on YouTube for the common knowledge and tricks that a creator needs. For example, you are required to press shift + alt + click to move around. This is probably something I wouldn't figure out and it is very important because when I first downloaded it, I only knew that Shift + clicks rotate your camera, but doesn't allow me to move to a different position, so when editing the object it was very difficult to click when it is far away to edit. The next step was for me to create and hammer as a weapon because in my opinion, it was the easiest model due to not having curves when compared to a sword. I used 4 cube blocks to create the handle then used 3 cube blocks to make the head of the weapon. My next step in learning this blog is to create an actual sword, able to put texture and color onto the weapon and any additional model I might create.

### 1/3/24:Modeling - Learning log 4.5 
Today tinker, I continue trying to a model for my sword. Using the same video from 12/10/23 I had difficulty following the video because the creator was going at a pace where I couldn't keep up. At each section of the video I had to stop and pause, so I could keep up and sometimes I had to rewind the video to make sure it was correct. In addition, the process was very long and tedious because the video was around 2 hours long [blender part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr1lgLAragg). Even though following along with the video, I wasn't going to perfectly make the exact replica of the sword in the video and change a few designs myself. This made me pretty proud of myself, but the unthinkable happened. When I tried to import into my Roblox apparently there was a limit of 10,000 data(mesh) that could be imported per entity. This challenge I had to overcome by using Google. Though there was a solution, after using the solution. it made the sword ugly, so my final alternative way was to create another sword, but much simpler. My next goal is to model a pickaxe and axe and then start learning more code. **<ins>Lastly when importing to roblox the texture and color don't get imported as well</ins>**

### 1/8/24:Roblox Animation - Learning Log 5: late work for 1/2/24
Today I tried a little of animation for roblox trying to make my own animation using an animation [tutorial](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=how+to+make+animation+in+roblox+studios&mid=AFCAE11AAE636ECAA926AFCAE11AAE636ECAA926&FORM=VIRE). Even though  I still didn't really research much about the scipting yet, but in this video, it teaches me how to animate and script into NPC(non player charcter) and player base script. Though these script were the basic, if I was able to create an if condition onto these animation I could change when the animation should be played.

### 1/15/24:Roblox Animation - Learning Log 6
Today I went to youtube and search up how to code running/walking video, most of them are old. I could still some of the video. This video was a disaster because I didn't understand most of the code espically the animation section near at the end of the [Runnning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiuCUWrN4mI) video. I didn't give up and started looking at another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sulk01JX3QI). For some reason it also didn't work, so I conclude that it might be because it outdate or I just don't understand the code and have to restart from the start from these two video - [video1](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=learning+lua+20min&mid=B551C9D4D47E6CD2B51AB551C9D4D47E6CD2B51A&FORM=VIRE) and [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEMFMuNesyM)


### 1/29/24:Roblox Running Code - Learning Log 7
While watching the two videos I also watched other videos that might be useful for me, it wasn't that helpful because during the time of my research, I was still a beginner level coding in Roblox, but having javascript and Java experience. The video helps me figure out how I can look at my output. This helped me a lot because it told me the error that was needed to solve my problem with the user input. It states `InputEnd is not a valid member of UserInputService "UserInputService"`. This leads me to a different approach start digging more in the [roblox documentation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#Running) again and tinkering around with it. I later discovered the reason I was getting this error was because the code inside of the InputEnd was not valid to use leading me to have this conflict. During this time I wasn't able to completely fix my problem and achieve a small section of the finished product, but also led me to a new lead for solving my problem. I hope to continue and to be able to complete in time with also complete my other tasks for the game.


### 3/3/24:Roblox Running Code - Learning Log 8
Today I followed my MVP plan - which is making modeling, I model a tree, and rock and still have to continue to model sticks pickaxe, and axe. Currently, I'm just getting some inspiration from images, games, and mostly [YouTube](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#Running). To complete this task I went on the blender again and started making a new model for it. I also tried to my some models in Roblox, but I found out that it gonna be mostly because they have curves. In the picture below You can see some of my models. At the back was an initial design for my tree, but didn't finish it because it looked like a palm tree in the finishing product and that wasn't something I wanted.

### 4/14/24 - Learning log 9 
Note - The learning log should have been probably be at 11 instead of 9 
<br>

This week I tried to make more interaction between a user and the game. Over the weeks, I realize finished my game was impossible, I even talked to Tamin who was working on something similar to me. His was some sort of a fighting game, while mine is like an open-world exploration RPG that including fighting, mining, etc. Since it was way too much I decided on a detour, I wanted to let the game have a purpose, so I decided to make a treasure hunt game where the user goes out and just finds the chest.
<br> 
This my currently place holder for my chest.

<br>

### codes 
This is my code for the chest and yea I agree it is not much because there are other attachment code that should be made given it to and an exmaple would be when the user press e it will connect to the chat and state "this user have found a chest blah blah". I had many trial and error trying to figure out how to solve it, but still couldn't, so I'm trying a different approach and it is, instead of it saying in the chat it will make a pop ui and it will only be seen by the user stating "congradation you found chest 1".
