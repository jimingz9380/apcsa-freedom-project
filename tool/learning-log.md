### 12/10/23: Modeling Learning log 4
Today, I am trying to create models for my game using Blender to be able to make some weapon models, and due to my lack of experience of never using Blender before I had to search online on YouTube for the common knowledge and tricks that a creator needs. For example, you are required to press shift + alt + click to move around. This is probably something I wouldn't figure out and it is very important because when I first downloaded it, I only knew that Shift + clicks rotate your camera, but doesn't allow me to move to a different position, so when editing the object it was very difficult to click when it is far away to edit. The next step was for me to create and hammer as a weapon because in my opinion, it was the easiest model due to not having curves when compared to a sword. I used 4 cube blocks to create the handle then used 3 cube blocks to make the head of the weapon. My next step in learning this blog is to create an actual sword, able to put texture and color onto the weapon and any additional model I might create.

### 1/3/24:Modeling - Learning log 4.5 
Today tinker, I continue trying to a model for my sword. Using the same video from 12/10/23 I had difficulty following the video because the creator was going at a pace where I couldn't keep up. At each section of the video I had to stop and pause, so I could keep up and sometimes I had to rewind the video to make sure it was correct. In addition, the process was very long and tedious because the video was around 2 hours long [blender part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr1lgLAragg). Even though following along with the video, I wasn't going to perfectly make the exact replica of the sword in the video and change a few designs myself. This made me pretty proud of myself, but the unthinkable happened. When I tried to import into my Roblox apparently there was a limit of 10,000 data(mesh) that could be imported per entity. This challenge I had to overcome by using Google. Though there was a solution, after using the solution. it made the sword ugly, so my final alternative way was to create another sword, but much simpler. My next goal is to model a pickaxe and axe and then start learning more code. **<ins>Lastly when importing to roblox the texture and color don't get imported as well</ins>**

### 1/8/24:Roblox Animation - Learning Log 5: late work for 1/2/24
Today I tried a little of animation for roblox trying to make my own animation using an animation [tutorial](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=how+to+make+animation+in+roblox+studios&mid=AFCAE11AAE636ECAA926AFCAE11AAE636ECAA926&FORM=VIRE). Even though  I still didn't really research much about the scipting yet, but in this video, it teaches me how to animate and script into NPC(non player charcter) and player base script. Though these script were the basic, if I was able to create an if condition onto these animation I could change when the animation should be played.

### 1/15/24:Roblox Animation - Learning Log 6
Todat I went to youtube and search up how to code running/walking video, most of them are old. I could still some of the video. This video was a disaster because I didn't understand most of the code espically the animation section near at the end of the [Runnning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiuCUWrN4mI) video. I didn't give up and started looking at another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sulk01JX3QI). For some reason it also didn't work, so I conclude that it might be because it outdate or I just don't understand the code and have to restart from the start from these two video - [video1](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=learning+lua+20min&mid=B551C9D4D47E6CD2B51AB551C9D4D47E6CD2B51A&FORM=VIRE) and (video2)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEMFMuNesyM]
