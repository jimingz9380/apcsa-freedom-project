# Freedom Project & presentation
##### 6/6/24

### Context 
Finally this is my last blog of the year and the entire school year because afterward I'm going to college. This celebrating my accomplishment on completing my project and able to present it to the judges. Despite not winning, I was able to learn a lot from it. My complete MVP, I have a map, couple model, running script and punching script working. There were minor creation with the game such as the GUI and achievement player are able to discover. Later my Beyond MVP, it was my cross platform user friendly because most of the script I made are only accessible to pc user.

### Expo
After completing my punching code and running the code that I receive from YouTube. I have started working my a semi-finished GUI where player can see their stats, inventory, collection, and crafting. To complete this I started creating a `GUISCreen` in the Roblox addon then inside I added a frame - changing its attributes such as size(scale), color background, etc. I found this very similar to HTML and CSS, but it doesn't use code but is similar to like addon, and the addon is an attribute for you to customize. The only functional code here was when the player joined and when they clicked the menu the GUI would show on the player `Name: #######`, it will become the player user when they join. 



### Takeaway
In the beginning, I stated "Despite not winning", I know I should still be happy with my accomplishment because of the effort and time I have put into my last project. One of the few takeaways from my presentation on the project was procrastination which helped me know something I will need to do and practice before college starts and I think it should be easy since I need to have better time management, even if the progress is slow. It is still progress!
