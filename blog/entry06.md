# Freedom Project & presentation
##### 6/6/24

### Context 
Finally this is my last blog of the year and the entire school year because afterward I'm going to college. This celebrating my accomplishment on completing my project and able to present it to the judges. Despite not winning, I was able to learn a lot from it. My complete MVP, I have a map, couple model, running script and punching script working. There were minor creation with the game such as the GUI and achievement player are able to discover. Later my Beyond MVP, it was my cross platform user friendly because most of the script I made are only accessible to pc user.

### Expo
On the day of the Expo, I was late, but luckily I made it time before the judge came into my turn to present on my [roblox game](https://www.roblox.com/games/16620055741/FreeBlox-World?gameSetTypeId=100000003&homePageSessionInfo=d17ec867-d1f4-43ad-bcdd-fdecb6efa9d9&isAd=false&numberOfLoadedTiles=50&page=sortDetailPageHome&placeId=16620055741&position=17&universeId=5718462318) called Freeblox World. To be honest, I didn't practice my pitch except for a very mock pitch with my friend during the class. I learned that even though you didn't practice with experience of the past, self-confidence and being yourself also allow you to do great in your elevator pitch. My first judge stated my project was great while others didn't agree with him. This made me speculate that it might be affected by the fact that they aren't gamers and don't understand the value of the project. This is why I believe that despite not winning, I believe I did great.

Note: didn't use it, but very similar

### Presentation
During the in-class [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13gKksryB12bg1f-iPh0vkFDsZ6VrvUG-StNotLeTEDk/edit#slide=id.g2df90af2ace_0_3015), I felt like I did great on it. When the result came back from the teacher's opinion I didn't get a full score. I lacked coherent and visual because my video wasn't ready on the day of the presentation and somehow my picture was blurry for the people in the back to see or based on the teacher's view. For some reason in the past, I made the same mistake which was the visualize and think about why. Some maybe just thought how I can see it, but others can't. My other thought was maybe I would need to find software that could boost up picture quality because initially when I took the screenshot, the word might be small. Then I edited to zoom in, which made the word more pixelated and bigger. Overall my presentation is great however maybe I realize I can't be a great viluazier or need more practice on it somehow.

### Takeaway
In the beginning, I stated "Despite not winning", I know I should still be happy with my accomplishment because of the effort and time I have put into my last project. One of the few takeaways from my presentation on the project was procrastination which helped me know something I will need to do and practice before college starts and I think it should be easy since I need to have better time management, even if the progress is slow. It is still progress!
