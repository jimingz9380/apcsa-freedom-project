# Modeling

### 1/3/24: late work for 12/18/23
Today tinker, I continue trying to a model for my sword. Using the same video from 12/10/23 I had difficulty following the video because the creator was going at a pace where I couldn't keep up. At each section of the video I had to stop and pause, so I could keep up and sometimes I had to rewind the video to make sure it was correct. In addition, the process was very long and tedious because the video was around 2 hours long [blender part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr1lgLAragg). Even though following along with the video, I wasn't going to perfectly make the exact replica of the sword in the video and change a few designs myself. This made me pretty proud of myself, but the unthinkable happened. When I tried to import into my Roblox apparently there was a limit of 10,000 data(mesh) that could be imported per entity. This challenge I had to overcome by using Google. Though there was a solution, after using the solution. it made the sword ugly, so my final alternative way was to create another sword, but much simpler. My next goal is to model a pickaxe and axe and then start learning more code. **<ins>Lastly when importing to roblox the texture and color don't get imported as well</ins>**
