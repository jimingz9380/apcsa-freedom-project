# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Jiming Zheng**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Lua** in order to help me make **a game in Roblox**. The game is called FreeBlox World. It is where user join and figth each other, while exploring the map to find chest. You can consider the game in beta stage because there isn't much to do except fighitng, map explorationg and a very small parkour place. I plan to add PVE, outer map design etc. I feel like there was so much thing I can add to the map while learning more new code from Lua and roblox documentation library.
